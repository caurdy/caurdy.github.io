The emails were generally from retailer or Mom&Pop customers concerning a variety of issues... availability, missing items, order confirmation, etc. Due to the amount of traffic, it was impossible for the associates to answer the most important emails on time. Thus, they came to our team (SCA) in order to find a solution which would cut down on time spent answering emails and figuring out which needed responses first. \n\n Solution: I created a Dash app which allowed users to upload emails in bulk. The application used an sklearn pipeline consisting of my own text cleansing function built specifically for emails, a TF-IDF vectorizer, and an SGD Classifier model (w/ hinge loss) to classify the email into one of seven categories. From there the email would be post-processed specifically for it's category. I.E. an email about availability would be scraped for item codes. The item codes would be fed through specific databases hosted in various platforms (Azure Data lake, SAP, Power BI) where the stock information about said item could be found. Then, the collected information was amalgamated and formatted into an email draft which the user could download and review before sending out. In theory this solution, if fully implemented, could save associates over 500+ hours per week in answering emails. This solution worked as a symbiotic tool so associate/customer behavior did not have to change while not invading privacy of our associates inboxes. Additionally, it avoided a lot of unnecessary bureaucratic time sinks which would delay development in an already short window.
